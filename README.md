Project 4 | Man in the Middle Attack\
This project is referenced from Seed Labs - Man in the Middle lab.\
In this project I analyzed the ARP protocol and started off with launching an ARP Poisoning Attack to cut communication between the victims. Then I managed to intercepted the traffic between the host after the first attack is done. Finally, I modified the captured traffic between the hosts and succesfully launched a Man in the Middle Attack. More details can be found on the report.
